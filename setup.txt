pip install -r requirements.txt

# Attention
Before execute setup.py, Please read below:
You have to rewrite many place.

## src/alphapose/setup.py(1)
'''
I had the problem and I've been able to solve it by doing what @Fang-Haoshu said. There is an if statement that makes setup.py skip some module installations if you're on Windows.

    Go to setup.py in your Alphapose folder.
    On line 124, comment out the "if" statement.

if platform.system() != 'Windows':
..........ext_modules = [... 

    Ensure you adjust the code block under the if statement (since you have removed the "if"). Make them one indent instead of two.
